# General

Script used to split the video into multiple frames which will be sent over to the FPGA

1 frame = 307200kb
@60fps, the data rate will need to be at least 18.432Mb/s

This is assuming I transfer only purely B/W pixels. 

Assuming multiple brighness levels (gradient part of the video),
I'll need to transfer
